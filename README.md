# SimulAT
A program to  generate eight million virtual people in Austria 

## Background
Given a set of publicly or privately available demographic data about a real population, it should be possible to generate a virtual population which is congruent to the demographhic data in sense of statistic distribution.

## How it works
Don't know yet!

## CUDA device sepcifics

Currently the package can be build and run on following devices:
- __Jetson Xavier (16GByte)__
- __Jetson Nano__
- __MacBook Pro__ (GForce 650m/1GByte)

## Data Preparation 

1. Sort Demographic data by Lat and Lon fields.
2. Set index for every raster record
3. Sort Eichamt data by Lat and Lon fields
